# Overview: Creating FFTs with FFTrees

The R package **FFTrees** (Phillips et al., 2017, 2023) makes it easy to
create, visualize, and evaluate fast-and-frugal decision trees (FFTs).
FFTs are simple and transparent decision algorithms for solving binary
classification problems in an effective and efficient fashion.

## Fast-and-Frugal Trees (FFTs)

A *fast-and-frugal tree* (FFT) (Martignon et al., 2003) is a set of
hierarchical rules for solving binary classification tasks based on very
little pieces of information (usually using 4 or fewer cues). In
contrast to more complex decision trees, each node of an FFT has exactly
two branches. A branch can either contain another cue (i.e., ask another
question) or lead to an exit (i.e., yield a decision or prediction
outcome).  
Each non-final node of an FFT has one exit branch and the final node has
two exit branches.

FFTs are simple and effective decision strategies that use minimal
information for making decisions in binary classification problems
(Gigerenzer et al., 1999; see Gigerenzer & Todd, 1999). FFTs are often
preferable to more complex decision strategies (such as logistic
regression, LR) because they rarely over-fit data (Gigerenzer &
Brighton, 2009) and are easy to interpret, implement, and communicate in
real-world settings (Marewski & Gigerenzer, 2012). FFTs have been
designed to tackle many real world tasks from making fast decisions in
emergency rooms (Green & Mehr, 1997) to detecting depression (Jenny et
al., 2013).

Whereas their performance and success are empirical questions, a key
theoretical advantage of FFTs is their *transparency* to decision makers
and anyone aiming to understand and evaluate the details of an
algorithm. In the words of Burton et al. (2020), “human users could
interpret, justify, control, and interact with a fast-and-frugal
decision aid” (p. 229).

## Using the FFTrees package

The **FFTrees** package makes it easy to produce, display, and evaluate
FFTs (Phillips et al., 2017). The package’s main function is
[`FFTrees()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/FFTrees.md)
which takes formula `formula` and dataset `data` arguments and returns
several FFTs that attempt to classify training cases into criterion
classes. The FFTs created can then be used to predict new data to
cross-validate their performance.

Here is an example of using the main
[`FFTrees()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/FFTrees.md)
function to fit FFTs to `heart.train` data:

``` r
# Create a fast-and-frugal tree (FFT) predicting heart disease:
heart.fft <- FFTrees(formula = diagnosis ~.,
                     data = heart.train,
                     data.test = heart.test,
                     main = "Heart Disease",
                     decision.labels = c("Healthy", "Diseased"))
```

The resulting `FFTrees` object `heart.fft` contains 7 FFTs that were
fitted to the `heart.test` data. To evaluate a tree’s predictive
performance, we compare its predictions for the un-trained `heart.test`
data with their true criterion values. Here is how we can apply the best
training FFT to the `heart.test` data:

``` r
# Visualize predictive performance:
plot(heart.fft, data = "test")
```

## Getting started

To start using the **FFTrees** package, we recommend studying the
[Tutorial: Creating FFTs for heart
disease](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/articles/FFTrees_heart.md).
The tutorial illustrates the basics steps of creating, visualizing, and
evaluating fast-and-frugal trees (FFTs). The scientific background of
FFTs and the development of **FFTrees** are described in Phillips et al.
(2017)
(doi [10.1017/S1930297500006239](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1930297500006239)

#### Details about the datasets

When preparing data to be predicted by FFTs, we usually distinguish
between several (categorical or numeric) predictors and a (binary)
criterion variable. **Table 1** provides basic information on the
datasets included in the **FFTrees** package (see their documentation
for additional details).
