# Manually specifying FFTs

## Manually specifying FFTs

We usually create fast-and-frugal trees (FFTs) from data by using the
[`FFTrees()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/FFTrees.md)
function (see the [Main guide: FFTrees
overview](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/articles/guide.md)
and the vignette on [Creating FFTs with
FFTrees()](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/articles/FFTrees_function.md)
for instructions). However, we occasionally may want to design and
evaluate specific FFTs (e.g., to test a hypothesis or include or exclude
some variables based on theoretical considerations).

There are two ways to manually define fast-and-frugal trees with the
[`FFTrees()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/FFTrees.md)
function:

1.  as a sentence using the `my.tree` argument (the easier way), or

2.  as a data frame using the `tree.definitions` argument (the harder
    way).

Both of these methods require some data to evaluate the performance of
FFTs, but will bypass the tree construction algorithms built into the
**FFTrees** package. As manually created FFTs are not optimized for
specific data, the key difference between fitting and predicting
disappears for such FFTs. Although we can still use two sets of ‘train’
vs. ‘test’ data, a manually defined FFT is not fitted and hence should
not be expected to perform systematically better on ‘train’ data than on
‘test’ data.

### 1. Using `my.tree`

The first method for manually defining an FFT is to use the `my.tree`
argument, where `my.tree` is a sentence describing a (single) FFT. When
this argument is specified in
[`FFTrees()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/FFTrees.md),
the function — or rather its auxiliary
[`fftrees_wordstofftrees()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/fftrees_wordstofftrees.md)
function — attempts to interpret the verbal description and convert it
into a valid definition of an FFT (as part of an `FFTrees` object).

For example, let’s use the `heartdisease` data to find out how some
predictor variables (e.g., `sex`, `age`, etc.) predict the criterion
variable (`diagnosis`):

| sex | age | thal   | cp  |  ca | diagnosis |
|----:|----:|:-------|:----|----:|:----------|
|   1 |  63 | fd     | ta  |   0 | FALSE     |
|   1 |  67 | normal | a   |   3 | TRUE      |
|   1 |  67 | rd     | a   |   2 | TRUE      |
|   1 |  37 | normal | np  |   0 | FALSE     |
|   0 |  41 | normal | aa  |   0 | FALSE     |
|   1 |  56 | normal | aa  |   0 | FALSE     |

**Table 1**: Five cues and the binary criterion variable `diagnosis` for
the first cases of the `heartdisease` data.

Here’s how we could verbally describe an FFT by using the first three
cues in conditional sentences:

``` r
in_words <- "If sex = 1, predict True.
             If age < 45, predict False. 
             If thal = {fd, normal}, predict True. 
             Otherwise, predict False."
```

As we will see shortly, the
[`FFTrees()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/FFTrees.md)
function accepts such descriptions (assigned here to a character string
`in_words`) as its `my.tree` argument, creates a corresponding FFT, and
evaluates it on a corresponding dataset.

#### Verbally defining FFTs

Here are some **instructions** for manually specifying trees:

- Each node must start with the word “If” and should correspond to the
  form: `If <CUE> <DIRECTION> <THRESHOLD>, predict <EXIT>`.

- Numeric thresholds should be specified directly (without brackets),
  like `age > 21`.

- For categorical variables, factor thresholds must be specified within
  curly braces, like `sex = {male}`. For factors with sets of values,
  categories within a threshold should be separated by commas like
  `eyecolor = {blue,brown}`.

- To specify cue directions, standard logical comparisons `=`, `!=`,
  `<`, `>=` (etc.) are valid. For numeric cues, only use `>`, `>=`, `<`,
  or `<=`. For factors, only use `=` or `!=`.

- Positive exits are indicated by `True`, while negative exits are
  specified by `False`.

- The final node of an FFT is always bi-directional (i.e., has both a
  positive and a negative exit). The description of the final node
  always mentions its positive (`True`) exit first. The text
  `Otherwise, predict EXIT` that we have included in the example above
  is actually not necessary (and ignored).

#### Example

Now, let’s use our verbal description of an FFT (assigned to `in_words`
above) as the `my.tree` argument of the
[`FFTrees()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/FFTrees.md)
function. This creates a corresponding FFT and applies it to the
`heartdisease` data:

``` r
# Create FFTrees from a verbal FFT description (as my.tree): 
my_fft <- FFTrees(formula = diagnosis ~.,
                  data = heartdisease,
                  main = "My 1st FFT", 
                  my.tree = in_words)
```

Running
[`FFTrees()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/FFTrees.md)
with the `my.tree` argument creates an object `my_fft` that contains one
FFT. A verbal description of this tree can be printed by
`inwords(my_fft)`, but we want to print or plot the object to evaluate
the tree’s performance on training or testing data. Let’s see how well
our manually constructed FFT (`my_fft`) did on the training data:

``` r
# Inspect FFTrees object:
plot(my_fft, data = "train")
```

![\*\*Figure 1\*\*: An FFT manually constructed using the \`my.tree\`
argument of
\`FFTrees()\`.](FFTrees_mytree_files/figure-html/my-tree-plot-1-1.png)

**Figure 1**: An FFT manually constructed using the `my.tree` argument
of
[`FFTrees()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/FFTrees.md).

When manually constructing a tree, the resulting `FFTrees` object only
contains a single FFT. Hence, the ROC plot (in the right bottom panel of
**Figure 1**) cannot show a range of FFTs, but locates the constructed
FFT in ROC space.

The formal definition of our new FFT is available from the `FFTrees`
object `my_fft`:

``` r
# Get FFT definition(s):
get_fft_df(my_fft)  # my_fft$trees$definitions
```

    #> # A tibble: 1 × 7
    #>    tree nodes classes cues         directions thresholds     exits  
    #>   <int> <int> <chr>   <chr>        <chr>      <chr>          <chr>  
    #> 1     1     3 n;n;c   sex;age;thal =;>=;=     1;45;fd,normal 1;0;0.5

Note that the 2nd node in this FFT (using the `age` cue) is predicting
the *noise* outcome (i.e., a non-final exit value of `0` or `FALSE`,
shown to the left). As our tree definitions always refer to the *signal*
outcome (i.e., a non-final exit value of `1` or `TRUE`, shown to the
right), the direction symbol of a left exit (i.e., the 2nd node in
**Figure 1**: if `age < 45`, predict `0` or noise) must be flipped
relative to its appearance in the tree definition (if `age >= 45`,
predict `1` or signal). Thus, the plot and the formal definition
describe the same FFT.

As it turns out, the performance of our first FFT created from a verbal
description is a mixed affair: The tree has a rather high sensitivity
(of 91%), but its low specificity (of only 10%) allows for many false
alarms. Consequently, its accuracy measures fail to exceed the baseline
level.

#### Creating an alternative FFT

Let’s see if we can come up with a better FFT. The following example
uses the cues `thal`, `cp`, and `ca` in the `my.tree` argument:

``` r
# Create a 2nd FFT from an alternative FFT description (as my.tree): 
my_fft_2 <- FFTrees(formula = diagnosis ~.,
                    data = heartdisease, 
                    main = "My 2nd FFT", 
                    my.tree = "If thal = {rd,fd}, predict True.
                               If cp != {a}, predict False. 
                               If ca > 1, predict True. 
                               Otherwise, predict False.")
```

As **FFTrees** aims to interpret the `my.tree` argument to the best of
its abilities, there is some flexibility in entering a verbal
description of an FFT. For instance, we also could have described our
desired FFT in more flowery terms:

``` r
# Create a 2nd FFT from an alternative FFT description (as my.tree): 
my_fft_2 <- FFTrees(formula = diagnosis ~.,
                    data = heartdisease, 
                    main = "My 2nd FFT", 
                    my.tree = "If thal equals {rd,fd}, we shall say True.  
                               When Cp differs from {a}, let's predict False. 
                               Whenever CA happens to exceed 1, we will insist on True.
                               Else, we give up and go away.") 
```

However, as the vocabulary of **FFTrees** is limited, it is safer to
enter cue directions in their symbolic form (i.e., using `=`, `<`, `<=`,
`>`, `>=`, or `!=`).[¹](#fn1) To verify that **FFTrees** interpreted our
`my.tree` description as intended, let’s check whether the FFT of
`inwords(my_fft_2)` yields a description that corresponds to what we
wanted:

``` r
inwords(my_fft_2)
```

    #> [1] "If thal = {rd,fd}, decide True."                 
    #> [2] "If cp != {a}, decide False."                     
    #> [3] "If ca > 1, decide True, otherwise, decide False."

As this seems (a more prosaic version of) what we wanted, let’s
visualize this tree (to evaluate its performance) and briefly inspect
its tree definition:

``` r
# Visualize FFT:
plot(my_fft_2)

# FFT definition:
get_fft_df(my_fft_2)  # my_fft_2$trees$definitions
#> # A tibble: 1 × 7
#>    tree nodes classes cues       directions thresholds exits  
#>   <int> <int> <chr>   <chr>      <chr>      <chr>      <chr>  
#> 1     1     3 c;c;n   thal;cp;ca =;=;>      rd,fd;a;1  1;0;0.5
# Note the flipped direction value for 2nd cue (exit = '0'):
# 'if (cp  = a), predict 1' in the tree definition corresponds to 
# 'if (cp != a), predict 0' in the my.tree description and plot.  
```

\`my.tree\` argument of
\`FFTrees()\`.](FFTrees_mytree_files/figure-html/my-tree-plot-fft-2-1.png)

**Figure 2**: Another FFT manually constructed using the `my.tree`
argument of
[`FFTrees()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/FFTrees.md).

This alternative FFT is nicely balancing sensitivity and specificity and
performs much better overall. Nevertheless, it is still far from perfect
— so check out whether you can create even better ones!

### 2. Using `tree.definitions`

More experienced users may want to define and evaluate more than one FFT
at a time. To achieve this, the
[`FFTrees()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/FFTrees.md)
function allows providing sets of `tree.definitions` (as a data frame).
However, as questions regarding specific trees usually arise later in
the exploration of FFTs, the `tree.definitions` argument is mostly used
in combination with an existing `FFTrees` object `x`. In this case, most
parameters (e.g., regarding the `formula`, `data` and various goals)
from the `FFTrees` object `x` are being kept, but the object is
re-evaluated for a new set of `tree.definitions`.

As FFTs are simple and transparent rules for solving binary
classification problems, it would be neat to directly manipulate and
evaluate these rules. For this purpose, **FFTrees** provides a set of
tree manipulation functions (see **Figure 3** below). Some of these
functions extract sets of existing FFT definitions (from `x`) and
convert individual FFT definitions into a more manageable (“tidy”)
format. Other functions allow to edit and trim these FFT definitions
(e.g., by adding, changing, reordering or removing nodes). Finally,
further functions allow to re-convert individual FFT definitions into
sets of definitions, and to collect and re-evaluate them on data.

The basic workflow to get, change, and use FFT definitions contains five
steps:

1.  Get (sets of) FFT definitions
2.  Select and convert an individual FFT into a tidy data format
3.  Manipulate the FFT (e.g., by changing its nodes or exits)
4.  Re-convert the changed definition into the original data format
5.  Collect sets of changed FFT definitions and/or evaluate them on data

Conceptually, this workflow boils down to first creating an FFT model
for some data, then manipulating the model, and finally re-evaluating it
on the data. The tools involved in this workflow allow editing the
grammar of FFTs.

#### Overview: Retrieving, manipulating, and using FFT definitions

![\*\*Figure 3\*\*: Overview of 4 tree definition and conversion
functions (in yellow)\<br\>and 6 tree trimming functions (in
blue).](gFFTs.png)

**Figure 3**: Overview of 4 tree definition and conversion functions (in
yellow)  
and 6 tree trimming functions (in blue).

**Figure 3** provides an overview of the functions provided for
converting and manipulating FFT definitions. We can distinguish between
three cycles:

- **Cycle 1**: Obtaining and collecting sets of FFT definitions. The
  main
  [`FFTrees()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/FFTrees.md)
  function creates an `FFTrees` object `x` with and from corresponding
  tree definitions. The following functions get, collect, and evaluate
  FFT definitions:
  1.  [`get_fft_df()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/get_fft_df.md)
      extracts the set of current FFT definitions (from
      `x$trees$definitions`).  
  2.  [`add_fft_df()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/add_fft_df.md)
      adds one or more FFT definitions to an existing set of FFT
      definitions. Thus, the function allows collecting sets of
      FFT definitions.  
  3.  the `tree.definitions` argument of the main
      [`FFTrees()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/FFTrees.md)
      function allows evaluating sets of FFT definitions for some data.
- **Cycle 2**: Converting between two tree definition formats (both
  stored as data frames):
  1.  [`read_fft_df()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/read_fft_df.md)
      selects a single FFT from a set of FFT definitions and converts it
      into a tidy data format (as a data frame in which each row
      represents a node).
  2.  [`write_fft_df()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/write_fft_df.md)
      converts a single FFT from the tidy data frame (with
      1-row-per-node) into the 1-row-per FFT format used by
      [`add_fft_df()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/add_fft_df.md)
      and the `tree.definitions` argument of
      [`FFTrees()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/FFTrees.md).
- **Cycle 3**: Manipulating an individual tree definition by a set of
  tree editing and trimming functions:
  - [`add_nodes()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/add_nodes.md)
    allows adding new nodes to an FFT;
  - [`drop_nodes()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/drop_nodes.md)
    allows deleting nodes of an FFT;
  - [`edit_nodes()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/edit_nodes.md)
    allows changing existing nodes of an FFT;
  - [`flip_exits()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/flip_exits.md)
    allows changing the exit direction of existing nodes;
  - [`reorder_nodes()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/reorder_nodes.md)
    allows changing the order of FFT nodes;
  - [`select_nodes()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/select_nodes.md)
    allows filtering existing nodes of an FFT.

The following example illustrates the interplay of these functions in a
typical workflow. When looking at **Figure 3**, we first move down on
the right side (from retrieving sets of FFT definitions to manipulating
individual FFTs) and then move up on the left side (to re-convert
individual FFTs into sets of FFT definitions).

#### Example

We illustrate a typical workflow by redefining some FFTs that were built
in the [Tutorial: FFTs for heart
disease](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/articles/FFTrees_heart.md)
and evaluating them on the (full) `heartdisease` data.

To obtain a set of existing tree definitions, we use our default
algorithm to create an `FFTrees` object `x`:

``` r
# Create an FFTrees object x:
x <- FFTrees(formula = diagnosis ~ .,           # criterion and (all) predictors
             data = heart.train,                # training data
             data.test = heart.test,            # testing data
             main = "Heart Disease 1",          # initial label
             decision.labels = c("low risk", "high risk"),  # exit labels
             quiet = TRUE)                      # hide user feedback
```

As we have seen in the
[Tutorial](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/articles/FFTrees_heart.md),
evaluating this expression yields a set of 7 FFTs. Rather than
evaluating them individually (e.g., by using `print(x)` or `plot(x)`
commands to inspect specific trees), we now extract the tree definitions
to select and modify individual FFTs. As the definitions are stored as
part of the `FFTrees` object `x`, this could be achieved by evaluating
`x$trees$definitions` or by `summary(x)$definitions`. Alternatively, we
can use the
[`get_fft_df()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/get_fft_df.md)
utility function on `x` to obtain the set of generated tree definitions:

``` r
# Get tree definitions of x:
(tree_dfs <- get_fft_df(x))
```

    #> # A tibble: 7 × 7
    #>    tree nodes classes cues             directions thresholds          exits    
    #>   <int> <int> <chr>   <chr>            <chr>      <chr>               <chr>    
    #> 1     1     3 c;c;n   thal;cp;ca       =;=;>      rd,fd;a;0           1;0;0.5  
    #> 2     2     4 c;c;n;c thal;cp;ca;slope =;=;>;=    rd,fd;a;0;flat,down 1;0;1;0.5
    #> 3     3     3 c;c;n   thal;cp;ca       =;=;>      rd,fd;a;0           0;1;0.5  
    #> 4     4     4 c;c;n;c thal;cp;ca;slope =;=;>;=    rd,fd;a;0;flat,down 1;1;0;0.5
    #> 5     5     3 c;c;n   thal;cp;ca       =;=;>      rd,fd;a;0           0;0;0.5  
    #> 6     6     4 c;c;n;c thal;cp;ca;slope =;=;>;=    rd,fd;a;0;flat,down 0;0;0;0.5
    #> 7     7     4 c;c;n;c thal;cp;ca;slope =;=;>;=    rd,fd;a;0;flat,down 1;1;1;0.5

The resulting R object `tree_dfs` is a data frame with 7 variables. Each
of its 7 rows defines an FFT in the context of our current `FFTrees`
object `x` (see the vignette on [Creating FFTs with
FFTrees()](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/articles/FFTrees_function.md)
for help on interpreting tree definitions). As the “ifan” algorithm
responsible for creating these trees yields a family of highly similar
FFTs (which vary only by their exits, and may truncate some cues), we
may want to explore alternative versions of these trees.

All 7 FFTs defined in `tree_dfs` share the three cues `thal`, `cp`,
and `ca`, in this order. Let’s assume we had reasons to explore the cue
order `thal`, `ca`, and `cp`.

#### Obtaining individual tree definitions

Before we can apply our tree editing functions, we first select an
initial FFT that we want to manipulate further. This is the job of
[`read_fft_df()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/read_fft_df.md)
(see **Cycle 2** of **Figure 3**):

- [`read_fft_df()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/read_fft_df.md)
  selects an FFT definition and converts it into a tidy data frame.

In our present case, we select and convert tree `1`:

``` r
(fft_1 <- read_fft_df(ffts_df = tree_dfs, tree = 1))
```

    #>   class  cue direction threshold exit
    #> 1     c thal         =     rd,fd    1
    #> 2     c   cp         =         a    0
    #> 3     n   ca         >         0  0.5

The resulting R object `fft_1` selected the definition of tree 1 and
converted it into a tidy data frame. Each of its 3 rows defines a node
of this FFT. This format can be understood and manipulated more easily
than the more compact format used in row 1 of `tree_dfs` (but both
formats can be converted into each other by the complementary functions
[`read_fft_df()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/read_fft_df.md)
and
[`write_fft_df()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/write_fft_df.md)).

#### Manipulating individual tree definitions

Having selected one FFT and converted it into a tidy data frame `fft_1`,
we can use various tree trimming functions to edit or manipulate the
definition of an individual tree (see **Cycle 3** of **Figure 3**).

**Reordering nodes**  
In our example, our selected FFT uses the cues `thal`, `cp`, and `ca`,
but we wanted to explore the alternative cue order `thal`, `ca`,
and `cp`. In other words, we need to swap the order of the 2nd and
3rd cues of `fft_1`. This is the purpose of the
[`reorder_nodes()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/reorder_nodes.md)
function:

- [`reorder_nodes()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/reorder_nodes.md)
  allows changing the order of FFT nodes.

In contrast to the
[`read_fft_df()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/read_fft_df.md)
function above, the tree editing functions of **Cycle 3** all require an
individual FFT-definition (as a tidy data frame) as their first
argument `fft`. In the case of
[`reorder_nodes()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/reorder_nodes.md),
the second argument `order` specifies a numeric vector for the desired
node positions (i.e., the integers from 1 to `nrow(fft)` in any order).
Thus, swapping the order of the 2nd and 3rd nodes of `fft_1` is achieved
as follows:

``` r
(my_fft_1 <- reorder_nodes(fft = fft_1, order = c(1, 3, 2)))
```

    #> reorder_nodes: Former exit node now is node 2
    #> 

    #>   class  cue direction threshold exit
    #> 1     c thal         =     rd,fd    1
    #> 2     n   ca         >         0    1
    #> 3     c   cp         =         a  0.5

Swapping the final two nodes implies that the final node of `fft_1`
(using the numerical cue `ca`) becomes a non-final cue, whereas the
previous middle node (using a categorical cue `cp`) becomes a final cue
(see the corresponding feedback message). By default, the previous exit
cue becomes a signal exit (here: exit 1, i.e., predicting a TRUE value
for the `diagnosis` criterion). Saving the resulting tree definition
(stored in the same tidy data frame format as `fft_1`) as an R object
`my_fft_1` will allow us to collect our modified FFTs later.

**Flipping exits** As we had no specific exit structure in mind when
deciding to explore the cue order `thal`, `ca`, and `cp`, we will
explore all possible exit directions. As every non-final node allows for
two alternative exits, a tree containing $n$ nodes has
$2^{(n - 1)}$ exit structures (i.e., $2^{2} = 4$ for 3 cues). The
$3$ exit structures in addition to `my_fft_1` can be obtained by
flipping the exit directions of the first, second, or both non-final
nodes. Each alternative can be achieved by applying the
[`flip_exits()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/flip_exits.md)
function to `my_fft_1`:

- [`flip_exits()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/flip_exits.md)
  allows changing the exit direction of existing nodes.

For instance, the tree definition with a signal exit at the first node
of `my_fft_1` can be reversed into a non-signal node as follows:

``` r
(my_fft_2 <- flip_exits(my_fft_1, nodes = 1))
```

    #>   class  cue direction threshold exit
    #> 1     c thal         =     rd,fd    0
    #> 2     n   ca         >         0    1
    #> 3     c   cp         =         a  0.5

#### Using **magrittr** pipes to combine steps

The tree conversion and editing functions do not need to be used
separately. As their first argument represents the data object to be
manipulated, they can be viewed as verbs in a tree manipulation language
and chained into longer command sequences by using the **magrittr** pipe
operator. For instance, reversing the exit of the 2nd cue of `my_fft_1`
could be achieved as follows:

``` r
library(magrittr)

(my_fft_3 <- my_fft_1 %>% 
  flip_exits(nodes = 2))
```

    #>   class  cue direction threshold exit
    #> 1     c thal         =     rd,fd    1
    #> 2     n   ca         >         0    0
    #> 3     c   cp         =         a  0.5

Similarly, the five steps from **FFTrees** object `x` to the tree
definition with the alternative exit structure of `my_fft_4` could be
chained into a single pipe as follows:

``` r
(my_fft_4 <- x %>% 
  get_fft_df() %>%
  read_fft_df(tree = 1) %>%
  reorder_nodes(order = c(1, 3, 2)) %>%
  flip_exits(nodes = c(1, 2)))
```

    #> reorder_nodes: Former exit node now is node 2
    #> 

    #>   class  cue direction threshold exit
    #> 1     c thal         =     rd,fd    0
    #> 2     n   ca         >         0    0
    #> 3     c   cp         =         a  0.5

To evaluate our four alternative tree definitions, we need to re-convert
them into the 1-line-per-FFT format (using
[`write_fft_df()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/write_fft_df.md))
and gather them in a single data frame (using
[`add_fft_df()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/add_fft_df.md)).
In **Figure 3**, this corresponds to moving upwards on the left (from
individual FFT definitions in a tidy data frame to combining sets of FFT
definitions in a single data frame).

#### Re-converting and collecting sets of tree definitions

Having created four modified tree definitions (i.e., `my_fft_1` to
`my_fft_4`), we now want to re-convert them from the tidy data frame
(with each row representing an FFT node) to the (non-tidy) data frame
format (in which each row represents and entire FFT). The more compact
format allows us to gather several FFT definitions in one data frame, so
that we can evaluate them together for some data in a call to the main
[`FFTrees()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/FFTrees.md)
function. In **Figure 3**, the corresponding steps are shown on the left
sides of **Cycle 2** and **Cycle 1**.

To re-convert between the two tree definition formats (both stored as
data frames), we use the
[`write_fft_df()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/write_fft_df.md)
function:

- [`write_fft_df()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/write_fft_df.md)
  converts a single FFT from the tidy data frame (with 1-row-per-node)
  into the 1-row-per FFT format used by
  [`add_fft_df()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/add_fft_df.md)
  and the `tree.definitions` argument of
  [`FFTrees()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/FFTrees.md).

In addition to the FFT definition to convert (e.g., `my_fft_1`), the
`tree` argument allows providing a numeric ID which will later allow us
to identify the FFT within a set:

``` r
(my_tree_dfs <- write_fft_df(my_fft_1, tree = 1))
```

    #>   tree nodes classes       cues directions thresholds   exits
    #> 1    1     3   c;n;c thal;ca;cp      =;>;=  rd,fd;0;a 1;1;0.5

This creates an R object `my_tree_dfs` as a (non-tidy) data frame in
which the definition of `my_fft_1` occupies only one row.

Next, we add the other FFT definitions to the `my_tree_dfs` data frame.
This can be achieved by the
[`add_fft_df()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/add_fft_df.md)
function:

- [`add_fft_df()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/add_fft_df.md)
  adds one or more FFT definitions to an existing set of FFT
  definitions. Thus, the function allows collecting sets of FFT
  definitions.

However, as this first requires converting each of the tidy FFT
definitions into the more compact 1-row-per FFT format, we use a series
of command pipes. Each pipe starts from a tidy FFT definition and
applies
[`write_fft_df()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/write_fft_df.md)
(with an ID) and `add_fft_df` (to `my_tree_dfs`), before re-assigning
the modified data frame as `my_tree_dfs` again:

``` r
my_tree_dfs <- my_fft_2 %>%
  write_fft_df(tree = 2) %>%
  add_fft_df(my_tree_dfs)

my_tree_dfs <- my_fft_3 %>%
  write_fft_df(tree = 3) %>%
  add_fft_df(my_tree_dfs)

my_tree_dfs <- my_fft_4 %>%
  write_fft_df(tree = 4) %>%
  add_fft_df(my_tree_dfs)

my_tree_dfs
```

    #>   tree nodes classes       cues directions thresholds   exits
    #> 1    1     3   c;n;c thal;ca;cp      =;>;=  rd,fd;0;a 1;1;0.5
    #> 2    2     3   c;n;c thal;ca;cp      =;>;=  rd,fd;0;a 0;1;0.5
    #> 3    3     3   c;n;c thal;ca;cp      =;>;=  rd,fd;0;a 1;0;0.5
    #> 4    4     3   c;n;c thal;ca;cp      =;>;=  rd,fd;0;a 0;0;0.5

The resulting data frame `my_tree_dfs` contains 4 FFT definitions in its
4 rows. Per our design (above), they only differ in the values of their
`tree` ID and the structures of their `exits`.

#### Applying sets of tree definitions to data

Having edited and collected a set of tree definitions, we now can
evaluate the corresponding FFTs on some data. We can do this by
providing our set of tree definitions (stored in the `my_tree_dfs` data
frame) to the `tree.definitions` argument of the main
[`FFTrees()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/FFTrees.md)
function:

- The `tree.definitions` argument of the main
  [`FFTrees()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/FFTrees.md)
  function allows evaluating sets of FFT definitions for some data.

When using the main
[`FFTrees()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/FFTrees.md)
function with a set of `tree.definitions` (as a data frame in which each
line contains the definition of one FFT), we can provide an existing
`FFTrees` object (e.g., `x` from above). Importantly, however, the input
of `tree.definitions` prevents the generation of new FFTs (via the
“ifan” or “dfan” algorithms) and instead evaluates the FFT definitions
provided on the data specified:[²](#fn2)

``` r
# Evaluate new tree.definitions for an existing FFTrees object x:
y <- FFTrees(object = x,                      # existing FFTrees object x
             tree.definitions = my_tree_dfs,  # new set of FFT definitions
             main = "Heart Disease 2"         # new label
             )
```

As we can see from the feedback messages, providing an `FFTrees` object
(here `x`) re-uses its datasets, parameters, and labels, unless they are
overwritten by new values. The resulting `FFTrees` object `y` contains
the summary statistics resulting from applying the 4 FFT definitions of
`my_tree_dfs` to the datasets that were used to create `x` (i.e.,
`data = heart.train` and `data.test = heart.test`).

We now can assess and visualize the performance of the FFTs in the usual
ways, e.g., by the [`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html),
[`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) and
[`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html) functions for
`y` or its trees:

``` r
summary(y)
```

```

Comparing the accuracy statistics of our new FFTs (in object `y`) to our
original FFTs (in object `x`) shows that swapping the 2nd and 3rd cue
had hardly an effect. Upon reflection, this is not surprising: Most
people are still classified into the same categories as before. However,
if we were to evaluate the costs of classification (e.g., by considering
the `pci` and `mcu` measures or the `cost` measures for cue usage), we
could still detect differences between FFTs that show the same accuracy.

#### Details

We just created a new `FFTrees` object `y` by using `FFTrees` object `x`
for a set of customized FFTs defined by the `tree.definitions` argument.
This circumvented the FFT building algorithms and used the provided FFT
definitions instead. Thus, the ordinary distinction between training and
test data no longer applies in this context: As no model is being fitted
here, both sets were used to evaluate the FFTs in `tree.definitions` on
these data. Acknowledging this, we may use the full dataset of
`heartdisease`, rather than splitting it into two distinct subsets:

``` r
# Create a new FFTrees object z:
z <- FFTrees(formula = diagnosis ~ .,
             data = heartdisease,             # using full dataset
             tree.definitions = my_tree_dfs,  # new set of FFT definitions
             main = "Heart Disease 3"         # new label
             )
```

As before, we can evaluate the performance of our FFTs by obtaining a
summary, or printing or plotting individual FFTs from the `FFTrees`
object `z`:

``` r
# Summarize results: 
summary(z)

# Visualize an FFT:
plot(z, tree = 1)
```

Finally, if we mostly care about comparing our new FFTs with the
automatically created ones, we could have added our new set
`my_tree_dfs` to the old set (`tree_dfs`, obtained from `x` above).

``` r
(all_fft_dfs <- add_fft_df(my_tree_dfs, tree_dfs))
```

    #>  5     5     3 c;c;n   thal;cp;ca       =;=;>      rd,fd;a;0           0;0;0.5  
    #>  6     6     4 c;c;n;c thal;cp;ca;slope =;=;>;=    rd,fd;a;0;flat,down 0;0;0;0.5
    #>  7     7     4 c;c;n;c thal;cp;ca;slope =;=;>;=    rd,fd;a;0;flat,down 1;1;1;0.5
    #>  8     8     3 c;n;c   thal;ca;cp       =;>;=      rd,fd;0;a           1;1;0.5  
    #>  9     9     3 c;n;c   thal;ca;cp       =;>;=      rd,fd;0;a           0;1;0.5  
    #> 10    10     3 c;n;c   thal;ca;cp       =;>;=      rd,fd;0;a           1;0;0.5  
    #> 11    11     3 c;n;c   thal;ca;cp       =;>;=      rd,fd;0;a           0;0;0.5

Doing so (e.g., by using the
[`add_fft_df()`](https://www.nathanieldphillips.co/FFTrees/reference/add_fft_df.md)
function) creates a superset of 11 tree definitions, which can be
evaluated together on the `heartdisease` data:

``` r
# Create a new FFTrees object a:
all <- FFTrees(formula = diagnosis ~ .,       
               data = heartdisease,             # using full dataset
               tree.definitions = all_fft_dfs,  # new set of FFT definitions
               main = "Heart Disease 4",        # new label
)

# Summarize results: 
summary(all)
```

Evaluating the performance of the corresponding FFTs (e.g., by
`summary(all)`) shows that reversing the final two cues had little to no
effects on accuracy (but note minor differences in costs, e.g.,
`mcu`).[³](#fn3)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Interpretable `my.tree` descriptions must avoid using “is” and “is
    not” without additional qualifications (like “equal”, “different”,
    “larger”, “smaller”, etc.).

2.  If the `tree.definitions` contain cue variables or values that
    cannot be found in the data, this will result in errors.

3.  Note that applying FFT definitions to data resulted in re-sorting
    the tree IDs according to the current `goal`.
